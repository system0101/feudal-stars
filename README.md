# Feudal Stars
This is my first foray into coding in a very long time, and I'm using this project as a hands-on learning experience. So the scope of this may change as I encounter immovable obstacles, or learn new tricks.

Feudal Stars will begin as a text-based, turn-based game where you pilot a ship through sectors, collect, buy and sell resources, find a place to make your own, or take whatever isn't bolted down for scrap. I'm intentionally dialing back expectations for the scope of the game as of right now, but a couple of the influences will be TradeWars2002 (and door games in general) and Stars!. I hope to make a game that will let you do the things listed above, and then I'll add complexity to the galaxy, so that eventually players will never have a lack of useful sectors to visit.

I am currently working on v0.0.2, which will add most of the fine structure of the galaxy and the basic movement controls of the game. Avoiding feature creep at this stage is an accomplishment in and of itself. This version will be the first that is testable, but will not yet have any gameplay.

v0.0.3 will finish/polish galaxy gen, add in the aforementioned fine structure to the game interface, and at this point I'll make some decisions about the overall theme and what will make the final cut of the first iteration of a completed Feudal Stars, as I learn more about project structure.
